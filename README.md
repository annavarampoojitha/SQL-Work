-- 2

UPDATE STUDENTS1 SET FIRST_NAME = 'Rohan', GRADES = 4 WHERE   ID = 'STD10251'; -- Update multiple columns at once.


-- 3

-- UPDATE with Subquery (Using Data from Another Table)

UPDATE students s

SET grade = (

    SELECT avg_grade
    
    FROM student_grades sg
    
    WHERE s.id = sg.student_id

)

WHERE s.id = 'STD10252';         -- This fetches avg_grade from student_grades and updates it in students

UPDATE students s

JOIN student_grades sg

ON s.id = sg.student_id

SET s.grade = sg.avg_grade

WHERE s.age > 10;      -- Updates grade by joining with another table.



-- 5

-- UPDATE with ORDER BY and LIMIT (MySQL-specific)

UPDATE students

SET age = age + 1

ORDER BY dob ASC

LIMIT 5;            -- This will update only the first 5 rows ordered by dob.


-- 6

-- UPDATE Using Case/Conditional Logic (Column-specific Conditions)

UPDATE students

SET grade = 

    CASE 
    
	WHEN age <= 10 THEN 5.0

-- 7

-- 8

-- UPDATE Using User Variables (MySQL)

UPDATE students

--    FROM students)

-- UPDATE students

-- SET grade = grade + 1

-- WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM ranked_students WHERE rank <= 5);     -- Updates only the top 5 students by grade ( NOT ALLOWED IN MYSQL).


-- DIFFEREBT WAYS OF USING DELETE

-- 1

-- Basic DELETE (Single Condition)

DELETE FROM students WHERE id = 'STD10252';   -- Deletes a single row where id matches.


-- 2

-- DELETE All Rows (Full Table Delete)

DELETE FROM students;         -- Deletes ALL rows in the table.


-- 3

-- DELETE with Multiple Conditions

DELETE FROM students WHERE age < 5 AND gender = 'Female';      -- Deletes all rows where both conditions are true.


-- 4

-- DELETE with Subquery (Delete Based on Data in Another Table)

DELETE FROM students

WHERE id IN (

    SELECT student_id
    
    FROM student_archive
    
    WHERE archive_date < '2020-01-01');                                                  -- Deletes rows where id exists in a subquery.


-- 5

-- DELETE with JOIN (MySQL & SQL Server)

DELETE s

FROM students s

JOIN student_archive sa

ON s.id = sa.student_id

WHERE sa.archive_date < '2020-01-01';                -- Deletes rows from students that match student_archive.





-- 6

-- DELETE with LIMIT (MySQL-specific)

DELETE FROM students WHERE age < 5 ORDER BY dob ASC LIMIT 10;         -- Deletes up to 10 rows matching the condition.



-- 7

-- DELETE with EXISTS Clause

DELETE FROM students s

WHERE EXISTS (

    SELECT 1
    
    FROM student_archive sa
    
    WHERE s.id = sa.student_id

);                                       -- Deletes rows if they exist in another table.


-- 8

-- DELETE with Common Table Expression (CTE) (SQL Server, PostgreSQL)

WITH old_students AS (

    SELECT id FROM students WHERE age > 50

)

DELETE FROM students

WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM old_students);       -- Deletes old students using a CTE.


-- 9


-- DELETE Using ORDER BY (PostgreSQL & MySQL)

DELETE FROM students

ORDER BY dob ASC

LIMIT 5;                     -- Deletes the oldest 5 students.


-- 10

-- DELETE with RETURNING (PostgreSQL & Oracle)

-- DELETE FROM students WHERE age < 5 RETURNING id, first_name, age;      -- Deletes rows and returns the deleted rows' data (works in PostgreSQL & Oracle).



-- DIFFERENT WAYS OF USING TRUNCATE

-- ⚡ Much faster than DELETE for full table deletion.

-- ⚠️ Cannot use WHERE clause — it removes all rows.

-- 🆓 In most databases, TRUNCATE also releases the storage space used by the table.

-- 🔄 In MySQL, it resets AUTO_INCREMENT values. Use DELETE if DO NOT RESET AUTO INCREMENT.

-- ❌ Cannot be rolled back in MySQL (unless using transactions in some storage engines like InnoDB).



-- 1

-- Basic TRUNCATE (Delete All Rows)

TRUNCATE TABLE students;            -- Removes all rows from students table.



-- 2

-- TRUNCATE with CASCADE (PostgreSQL)

-- TRUNCATE TABLE students CASCADE;         -- This removes all rows from students and related child tables with foreign key constraints.



-- 3

-- TRUNCATE Multiple Tables at Once (PostgreSQL)

-- TRUNCATE TABLE students, courses, enrollments;       -- Truncates multiple tables in one command.


-- 4

-- TRUNCATE with RESTART IDENTITY (PostgreSQL)

-- TRUNCATE TABLE students RESTART IDENTITY;           -- Removes all rows and resets all sequences linked to the table columns (like SERIAL columns).


-- 6

-- TRUNCATE with Commit Implications

-- In MySQL with InnoDB, TRUNCATE is implicitly committed.

-- In PostgreSQL, if inside a transaction, TRUNCATE can be rolled back.


-- DIFFERENT WAYS OF USING DROP
 
-- The DROP command in MySQL is used to permanently delete database objects like tables, databases, views, triggers, stored procedures, functions, etc.

-- It is a destructive operation — once you DROP something, you can't recover it unless you have a backup.

                
DROP TABLE students;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS students;

DROP DATABASE school_db;

DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS school_db;

DROP VIEW student_view;

DROP VIEW IF EXISTS student_view;

DROP PROCEDURE my_procedure;

DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS my_procedure;

DROP FUNCTION calculate_grade;

DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS calculate_grade;

DROP TRIGGER before_student_insert;

DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS before_student_insert;

DROP INDEX idx_student_name ON students;

DROP EVENT daily_cleanup;

DROP EVENT IF EXISTS daily_cleanup;



-- DROP is permanent (no rollback).

-- If foreign keys reference a table, DROP TABLE may fail (InnoDB).

-- Always check for IF EXISTS to avoid errors in scripts.



SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES=0;

/* SQL_SAFE_UPDATES is a MySQL system variable that prevents accidental updates or deletes without a WHERE clause or a LIMIT clause in safe mode.

By default, in MySQL Workbench or when connected in "safe mode", this variable is set to 1 (enabled).

This means you cannot run UPDATE or DELETE queries unless they have either:

A WHERE clause (which limits the rows to be affected), OR

A LIMIT clause (which limits the number of rows affected)         */

/*       Be Careful!

Disabling SQL_SAFE_UPDATES is risky in production environments because it:

Allows accidental full table updates.

Allows accidental full table deletions.

You might unintentionally wipe out critical data.       */


/*     Good Practice

Temporarily disable SQL_SAFE_UPDATES for the session only.

Re-enable it after your operation.

-- Disable safe updates

SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES=0;

-- Run your risky update

UPDATE students SET age = 10;

-- Re-enable safe updates (good habit after your changes)

SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES=1;             */
